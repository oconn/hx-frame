## Install

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/oconn/hx-frame.svg)](https://clojars.org/oconn/hx-frame)

**Note** This project is experimental and the API may change in future releases. I'm experimenting with swappable data storage technologies (Datascript & React Context are the two I'm experimenting with right now)
